                This institution takes in children and takes care of them by providing them with food, shelter and education. <br>
                If we inform more people about their situation then maybe we can promote their stories then maybe more people <br>
                will be moved by their backgrounds.</p>

                <p>Lycopene is considered a part of the Isoprenoid compound which itself is considered a Lipid due to its use in pigmentation and a part of how vitamins smell.
                    Lycopene is also responsible for the color of the tomato.

                 <h1 style="font-family:Segoe Script">Background of the study</h1>
                 <br><br>
                <p>The children of PPHC are kids that came from broken families, their homes are not capable of upbringing a child either because of the absence of their parents due to being active in
                 illegal actions and being in jail or their neglect of their kids, therefore their basic necessities cannot be fulfilled. As a result, the nuns of PPHC decided to take in some of these 
                 children because of the horrible living conditions and to provide them with their basic needs such as food, shelter, and education. Although they are able to meet these, there are still some setbacks, the biggest being their lack of education and education materials.</p>
                 <br><br>
                 <h1 style="font-family:Segoe Script">Significance of the project</h1>
                 <p>A person may utilize their knowledge to make a better judgment when they are educated, they are able to learn basic essential things in life like speaking,  reading, writing school,
                     and basic etiquette it also enhances the children’s critical thinking, therefore, increasing their success rate in life, enhancing their lifestyle, and giving out opportunities.
                      Through education, you may boost your chances of finding better employment possibilities and unlock new doors for yourself.Thus, by being aware of and adhering to rights, rules, and regulations, we may help create a better society in which to live.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h1 style="font-family:Segoe Script">Problem</h1>
                <p>Children from PPHC are neglected and abandoned, therefore they are malnourished and academically challenged. Malnourishment can cause the brain to underdevelop; the child’s speech, coordination, and memory may all be affected by nutritional deficits, which may hasten the rate at which your brain loses neurons. </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h1 style="font-family:Segoe Script">Intervention</h1>
                    <p>We can solve the problem by putting up a school supply drive. I believe that the proposed solution would be effective because the institution provides education. Still, from
                         the materials we’ve watched they were giving the impression that they lacked educational materials. If we can provide these things then they wouldn’t have to think about
                          how to provide the children with writing and reading materials. I believe the proposed solution is better than other alternatives merely because the donors do not have
                           to buy new school materials for them but they can put to use their old but reusable and good-condition educational materials. It would take time, effort, and patience to make it happen. We would also need the approval and support of the institution and others to make this proposal a reality.</p>
